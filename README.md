# Node.js oAuth Demo App - Salesforce as IDP
This is a demo application that showcases an implementation of oAuth from Salesforce in Node.js. 

## Installation
Firstly, setup your Salesforce Org with a [connected app](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/projects/workshop-electric-imp/steps/connected-app-setup). Remember! You will have to come back here and update your callback URL once you get it. 

### Building the App locally
Before you start, make sure you've got Redis running locally. (If not, it's okay - [we can wait](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart))

Firstly, clone (or fork and clone) the App.
````
git clone https://github.com/adamSellers/Salesforce-oAuth-Demo.git
````
Change directories and install stuff
````
cd Salesforce-oAuth-Demo && npm install
````
Create the .env file
````
touch .env
````
Then add the following config vars
````
CLIENTID={your salesforce client id}
CLIENTSECRET={your salesforce client secret}
CALLBACKURL=http://localhost:3001/salesforce/auth
REDISSECRET={A super secret string}
REDIS_URL={your redis URL}
````
remember, head back to your connected app and update that Callback URL!

Once all that is done, you are good to go!
````
npm start
````
Then navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to get started.
